# üè†üè¢ Deployment project

## üìú Description


This repository contains a web application where I have implemented a Random Forest model, serialized it using pickle, 
and compressed it using joblib. The backend of the project is powered by FastAPI, and the frontend is developed with Streamlit.
The model is deployed on Streamlit, while the FastAPI is deployed on Render. The integration between the FastAPI backend 
and the Streamlit frontend is accomplished using the requests library. 

This web application is designed to predict the price of a house based on user-provided inputs. 
The link to the deployed project is provided in the description.
